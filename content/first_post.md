Summary: This is a summary of the first post written for my Pelican Blog.  I'm using this for the 100daysofweb course.


##Woohoo!

This is the first paragraph of the article - yeet!

I'm writing this in markdown format so I can use two * symbols to indicate **bold** see?

###This is a smaller header...

And if I use a single * around some text...  *it prints out italicized*

The end! Yeet!
